# CSharp-Advanced-Delegates

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains three C# projects that demonstrate advanced concepts of **Delegates, Anonymous Methods, Lambda Expressions, Multicast Delegates, Func/Action/Predicate, Events, and Covariance/Contravariance**. Each project showcases how these concepts can be applied to real-world applications.

## 📚 Student Grading System
### Description
The **Student Grading System** is a console-based application built in **C#** to evaluate student performance using delegates. The project showcases the practical use of **Func, Action, and Predicate** to process and analyze student grades efficiently.

### 🎯 Features
- **Student Data Management:** Add students and enter their grades.
- **Grade Calculation:** Compute students' average grades dynamically.
- **Pass/Fail Evaluation:** Determine students' results based on predefined grading criteria.
- **Flexible Delegates:** Uses **Func, Action, and Predicate** for efficient grade processing.
- **Console-Based Interface:** Simple and interactive user experience.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Delegates (Func, Action, Predicate)**

### 📂 Project Structure
- `Program.cs` – Main entry point of the application.
- `Student.cs` – Represents student data including name, grades.
- `GradeProcessor.cs` – Implements delegate-based grade processing logic.
